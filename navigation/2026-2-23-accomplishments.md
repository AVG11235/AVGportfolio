## Hello!

Across my time in this class I have learned a key couple of things across my time here which was mainly how to operate coding websites and applications and since I have learned a fair bit of each of these coding apps, I'll show what I've learned categorized based on which site I learned what from, lets explain explain explain.

## VS Code

VS Code, we first used it for a bit in the website version, but then we learned how to use the downloaded version where we also learned how to operate folder based github repo's and connecting them all up to be able to operate and edit the code on here and send it to Github as well. I learned how use the explorer and how to paste and copy files into VS code like not using names with spaces. I also learned how to download a Windows/Ubuntu code helper from VS code too, I also got an AI helper from there as well. I learned how make a localhost how to commit as well

## GitHub



## Open Coding Society



## Terminal



## Code Runner
