## Our Game

I worked on the first level of the pirate Murder Mystery game's art which was presented at Night @ The Museum. This game was a neat way to work on a group project again after the first group project at tables, now at a class-wide scale, it felt well supporting my teammates and creating what they asked of me for the game and I trusted them to produce proper coding as well, I think our level went over pretty well even with all the stress throughout production.

## Sadly (/now this will cover past experiences) 

My experience was pretty horrendous because I wasn't there, as I needed to renew my visa so I can stay in the US, but I did come to these types of things before, and feel that would be nice to cover here instead. 

## Firstly

One of the first times I was here was when one of my sisters friends was doing a n@tm, and my family was also there checking out the school and the possible classes, so when we came here we first noticed how crowded and hot it was, and how most families here were Indians, and my father seeing my sister's friend's stock calculator project, and hearing John Mortonsen's speech really captivated him to have me in this class, so I'm here now (Don't worry though I myself was also interested in coding, I just feel the pacing in this class is too fast).

## Secondly/Lastly

At the end of the first Trimester My Editing/Video Creation Class made a N@tm submission where we had to make a compilation video of all we did as a demo reel, which was cool but for me a bit of a blunder as my QR code was cropped off as I didn't used the proper format, whoops he he.
