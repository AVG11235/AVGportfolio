## Hello!

Across my time in this class I have learned a key couple of things across my time here which was mainly how to operate coding websites and applications and since I have learned a fair bit of each of these coding apps, I'll show what I've learned categorized based on which site I learned what from, lets explain explain explain.   

## VS Code

VS Code, we first used it for a bit in the website version, but then we learned how to use the downloaded version where we also learned how to operate folder based github repo's and connecting them all up to be able to operate and edit the code on here and send it to Github as well. I learned how use the explorer and how to paste and copy files into VS code like not using names with spaces. I also learned how to download a Windows/Ubuntu code helper from VS code too, I also got an AI helper from there as well. I learned how make a localhost how to commit as well.

## GitHub

In Github we managed coding progress and a bit of group projects, so I learned how to make repositorys, and commit work, posting it online, and working with others on one project!

## Open Coding Society

Here we did a bunch of learning and accessed code runner, game runner, and lessons for the first time here. I learned how to make an account with my GitHub account, how to burndown lessons, use the calender, how to microblog, etc.

## Terminal

The terminal was used for many things but was much harder to learn. It was learned to be used to access folders, connect github to code, setup terminals code in ubuntu, clone files, etc. 

*mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/bin/git-credential-manager.exe"
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/activate_ubuntu.sh # prompts for your recently created WSL Ubuntu password
./scripts/activate.sh # prompts for Git UID and Personal Email
./scripts/venv.sh*

## Code Runner

Using the teaching classes we had I was able to learn how to make certain types coding formats and I also did a teaching where taught some JSON and Java script Objects

## Overall 

all these individual components and lessons helped me learn coding and technical resolve but  wish we practiced more coding itself as I feel with how specific it is, it's way too forgettable, and one mistake ruins the piece entirely, but a learned a nice byte.
